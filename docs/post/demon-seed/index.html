	<h2>Demon Seed Pixel Art Process</h2>

</div>

<p>This is the cover to <a href="https://joshuamorse.bandcamp.com/album/single-demon-seed-castlevania-3-arrangement">Demon Seed</a>, a HOT new Castlevania 3 remix by one of my favorite musicians, <a href="http://jmflava.com/#/welcome">Joshua Morse</a>.</p>
<p>When I make art for Joshua, I&#39;m always intimidated because my design needs to &quot;sit on the same shelf&quot; as his amazing music. To make it the best it can be, I take as much time as I can and put the design through its paces.</p>
<div>
  <img src="/media/images/post/demon-seed/ds_1_sketch1.jpg" alt="Demon Seed sketch 1">
</div>

<p>First I wanted to just start sketching to loosen up. Rather than going with whatever <a href="https://richtaur.deviantart.com/art/Kermit-eating-popcorn-with-duck-ears-obviously-671557419">nonsense</a> might be in my head, I went straight to the source and doodled a level from Castlevania 3.</p>
<p>This was not the direction we decided to go, but that&#39;s good information to have.</p>
<div>
  <img src="/media/images/post/demon-seed/ds_2_sketch2.jpg" alt="Demon Seed sketch 2">
</div>

<p>For the next sketch, I wanted to keep some of the elements that I liked drawing and looking at from the first sketch. Spikes, cubes, maybe some bats -- it looks more three-dimensional and it still felt like a Castlevania level.</p>
<div>
  <img src="/media/images/post/demon-seed/ds_3_sketch2_pixel_art_rough.jpg" alt="Demon Seed pixel rough">
</div>

<p>One fear of mine is that I&#39;ll forget I&#39;m working on pixel art and try to bite off more than I can chew. High resolution pixel art is time-consuming and difficult to pull off, so I wanted to try a quick pixel rough to see where this was headed.</p>
<div>
  <img src="/media/images/post/demon-seed/ds_4_sketch2_pixel_art_color_rough.jpg" alt="Demon Seed color rough">
</div>

<p>Coloring and shading are important for a piece like this, so I continued on to ensure things weren&#39;t getting out of hand. Sure enough, as I colored I was seeing signs that the resolution was too high for me to handle with the time I had. I&#39;d need to use a smaller canvas, which meant fewer elements and a simpler environment would be best.</p>
<p>Also, the words &quot;Demon Seed&quot; are so cool but look a little lost in this iteration. More emphasis on the title would benefit the design.</p>
<div>
  <img src="/media/images/post/demon-seed/ds_5_sketch.jpg" alt="Demon Seed sketch 3">
</div>

<p>After having gone through some paces, I had a good idea of what I could and wanted to make. The title would have a bigger role, which takes pressure off of the environment. The blocks stayed, along with some floating spikes and a skull because, ya know, Castlevania. I blocked everything out and it felt reasonable.</p>
<div>
  <img src="/media/images/post/demon-seed/ds_6_wip_1.jpg" alt="Demon Seed WIP 1">
</div>

<p>Next I began to render the pixels. I could tell immediately that the resolution was more my speed and at this size I&#39;d be able to make a better overall design.</p>
<div>
  <img src="/media/images/post/demon-seed/ds_7_wip_2.jpg" alt="Demon Seed WIP 2">
</div>

<p>Lastly I added the first pass of color. It looks anemic at this stage, but at low resolutions the detail can really shine, so I went straight into shading and polish.</p>
<p>You can see the final cover above, on <a href="https://richtaur.deviantart.com/art/Demon-Seed-album-cover-art-714296493">DeviantArt</a>, or on <a href="http://pixeljoint.com/pixelart/116904.htm">PixelJoint</a>.</p>
<div>
  <img src="/media/images/post/demon-seed/process.jpg" alt="Demon Seed process">
</div>

<p>Here&#39;s the entire process. The end result is not as good as <a href="https://joshuamorse.bandcamp.com/album/vlad-ii">VLAD II</a> but here we are. If I could do anything differently, I would have added more detail like creatures and treasure scattered around the blocks. Make it feel mossy by covering the surfaces ...</p>
<p><em>Now that I think about it, this <a href="https://joshuamorse.bandcamp.com/album/single-demon-seed-castlevania-3-arrangement">Demon Seed</a> piece came before <a href="/post/happy-surfaces/">Happy Surfaces</a>, and could have unconsciously laid the groundwork for it! More on that later.</em></p>
