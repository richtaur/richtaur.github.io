This is the cover to [Demon Seed](https://joshuamorse.bandcamp.com/album/single-demon-seed-castlevania-3-arrangement), a HOT new Castlevania 3 remix by one of my favorite musicians, [Joshua Morse](http://jmflava.com/#/welcome).

When I make art for Joshua, I'm always intimidated because my design needs to "sit on the same shelf" as his amazing music. To make it the best it can be, I take as much time as I can and put the design through its paces.

</div>

First I wanted to just start sketching to loosen up. Rather than going with whatever [nonsense](https://richtaur.deviantart.com/art/Kermit-eating-popcorn-with-duck-ears-obviously-671557419) might be in my head, I went straight to the source and doodled a level from Castlevania 3.

This was not the direction we decided to go, but that's good information to have.

For the next sketch, I wanted to keep some of the elements that I liked drawing and looking at from the first sketch. Spikes, cubes, maybe some bats -- it looks more three-dimensional and it still felt like a Castlevania level.

</div>

One fear of mine is that I'll forget I'm working on pixel art and try to bite off more than I can chew. High resolution pixel art is time-consuming and difficult to pull off, so I wanted to try a quick pixel rough to see where this was headed.

</div>

Coloring and shading are important for a piece like this, so I continued on to ensure things weren't getting out of hand. Sure enough, as I colored I was seeing signs that the resolution was too high for me to handle with the time I had. I'd need to use a smaller canvas, which meant fewer elements and a simpler environment would be best.

Also, the words "Demon Seed" are so cool but look a little lost in this iteration. More emphasis on the title would benefit the design.

After having gone through some paces, I had a good idea of what I could and wanted to make. The title would have a bigger role, which takes pressure off of the environment. The blocks stayed, along with some floating spikes and a skull because, ya know, Castlevania. I blocked everything out and it felt reasonable.

Next I began to render the pixels. I could tell immediately that the resolution was more my speed and at this size I'd be able to make a better overall design.

Lastly I added the first pass of color. It looks anemic at this stage, but at low resolutions the detail can really shine, so I went straight into shading and polish.

You can see the final cover above, on [DeviantArt](https://richtaur.deviantart.com/art/Demon-Seed-album-cover-art-714296493), or on [PixelJoint](http://pixeljoint.com/pixelart/116904.htm).

Here's the entire process. The end result is not as good as [VLAD II](https://joshuamorse.bandcamp.com/album/vlad-ii) but here we are. If I could do anything differently, I would have added more detail like creatures and treasure scattered around the blocks. Make it feel mossy by covering the surfaces ...

_Now that I think about it, this [Demon Seed](https://joshuamorse.bandcamp.com/album/single-demon-seed-castlevania-3-arrangement) piece came before [Happy Surfaces](/post/happy-surfaces/), and could have unconsciously laid the groundwork for it! More on that later._
