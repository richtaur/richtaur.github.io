Once upon a time, some [cute drawings](https://twitter.com/infiniteammodev/status/967095216128880640) by [bitmOO][twitter] popped up in my Twitter feed. The characters are appealing, cute, and looked easy to execute. With the simple color scheme and shapes it felt like a style I'd be able to do and would make for a fun study.

I started with the lion which also served as my warm up. The lion is a real big mess: too big, lacks a major shape, and the textured brush wasn't working for me. (Let this be a reminder: warming up is important -- your first drawing might be stiff and awkward.)

The other characters came out more naturally and I think they look increasingly more accurate as they go. By the bird character at the end, I was having fun and feeling confident.

Immediately after studying the characters, I doodled my own from imagination. There's a doggo, a lizard lady, a tigress with a fez, and a shark dude ready for the beach.

One can easily imagine the infinite possibilities within these simple parameters.

Looking at them later, I noticed some areas of improvement:

1. The doggo's face
2. Mysteriously thin lizard lines
3. A tangent and weird-looking medallion on the tigress
4. IDK man this shark dude is just A+

This was a fun exercise! If you love the source characters as much as I do, you should follow [bitmOO on Twitter][twitter] and check out her lovely [portfolio](https://bitmoo.me/).
