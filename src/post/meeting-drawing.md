This one began as a mindless doodle during a meeting. Sometimes I like to draw big circles and see where it goes.

The eye was kinda fun, but the tree needed a little hat so there it is. The hat was what convinced me to continue on to the line art.

Then came the local colors. Sometimes people call these flats.

  </a>
</div>

Then I shaded with just one or two levels of darkness and lighting. The eye got some extra attention because I really like banded shading.

Lastly, I polished it up with some paper texture and adjusted the light levels. The finished version is at the top of this page. Thanks for reading!
