A year or two ago, I was digging through my old folders of work-in-progress screenshots, [doodles][doodles], and [unfinished prototypes][prototypes].
Many of these works were never shared, and I was trying to think of a way to present them together.

Introducing [#365ThingsIMade][1], a collection of words and images that I find interesting and that represent my last decade of personal game development and other creative efforts. Each day in 2021, I'll be [posting][2] an image or video along with some thoughts about it.

The goal of this project is to present my work, get myself more comfortable with sharing (an ongoing battle), and encourage other creators.
This project kind of goes against one of my creative principles ([Don't Commit to an Interval][3]), but I think there are some exceptions here:

First, my intent is to do the lion's share of the work upfront -- that is, to schedule hundreds of tweets in late 2020 / early 2021 so that [#365ThingsIMade][1] isn't something I have to manage on a daily basis.
Second, the project is designed to last only one year so hopefully that'll prevent me from over-scoping or feeling any dread from having to maintain it for too long.

I had this idea back in 2019, but didn't do it for 2020 (the cursed year).
I don't really believe in regret, so let's do this thing!

If you're not on Twitter, good for you (seriously), and no worries: I'll post summaries here as well.
