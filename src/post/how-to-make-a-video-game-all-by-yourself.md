Hey hello hi who expected <em>this</em>? Certainly not me, a game developer who already juggles too many projects and struggles to finish them. But here we are: _I wrote a book for solo game developers!_

It's called [How to Make a Video Game All By Yourself][htmavgaby].

I've been coping with some things in recent years (as have we all by now), and one of my
comfort zones is expressing myself and being creative.
Running off unprepared on a new artistic journey is like a warm blanket to me.
There's still oceans for me to learn (as there always will be), but I'm at the point in my career where I know I have tons of valuable advice to offer fellow game developers.

This book has been bubbling up in the back of my mind for years, and suddenly being locked down and not
able to go outside for global health reasons ... well, that's awful, but also a perfect opportunity to work on a project I thought could be fun to make and help creative people like me.

And since you're here reading an art and game development blog, that's you too! I wrote this book for _you_. Seriously.

How about a <a href="/media/images/post/how-to-make-a-video-game-all-by-yourself/Banner_Grid_4x3.jpg">peek</a> inside?

What do you think? If you like what you see, [pre-order it][htmavgaby], I'd really appreciate it.
If you'd like to keep reading, there's much more here if you dig deeper ...

## Valadria

For example, along with the release of this book I've started a new company called [Valadria][valadria].
You can read more on the [about][about] page and if you want _even more_ sign up for the newsletter and you will get a downloadable package of assets called [Game Dev Medkit][gdmk].

If that sounds like a lot of stuff, I'm so glad!
I've been working hard on this for over a year and I'm excited for you to finally see it.

Thank you for reading. I hope these new offerings help you make video games.
