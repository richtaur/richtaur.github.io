Drawing can be the most fun when you don't know what you're going to draw.

Sometimes I like to make random marks until [a vision emerges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareidolia), like a mirage in the desert.

Some marks reveal specific forms. Some make only suggestions.

Due to its loose nature, the doodle is almost always missing a key detail. With a minor tweak, the clown now reaches inside the building. Now the clown shows violent intent. It is more menacing and the scene more harrowing.

Most [doodles](https://twitter.com/richtaur/status/1043337080229658626) make it to adolescence and are abandoned, which is fine. Usually they are too ambitious or aren't satisfying enough.

For whatever reason, this one held my attention longer than most.
