	<div class="post-contents">
		<p>There’s always pressure to produce content regularly.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.onegameamonth.com/">One game per month.</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.lostdecadegames.com/lostcast/">One podcast per week.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/Sketch_Dailies">One drawing per day.</a></p>
<p>Sometimes working on an interval can be great. It can help your audience find your work and establish a healthy rhythm.</p>
<p>But <strong>are you ready</strong> for an interval? Can you guarantee scheduled releases? What if you or a family member gets sick or injured? Will your audience resent you or abandon you if you cannot keep up?</p>
<p>Committing to weekly episodes essentially killed <a href="http://www.lostdecadegames.com/lostcast/">Lostcast</a>, the podcast I ran with <a href="http://www.geoffblair.com/">Geoff Blair</a> for six years. At first, we were producing episodes simply <strong>whenever it felt right</strong>. This format was flexible, but it felt like a half-step. Were we really dedicated to it? When is the next episode? How can our audience get excited when they don’t know what to expect, or to expect anything at all?</p>
<p>The idea of a <strong>weekly show</strong> sounded great, but when you combined planning, editing, 60+ minutes recording the damn thing, uploading the file, managing metadata across platforms, spreading the word …</p>
<p>In the face of life&#39;s normal responsibilities, sometimes it was too much. I would often find myself resenting that day of the week because it was more stressful, had more responsibilities, and teased the potential for a more spectacular <strong>public fail</strong> than an average day.</p>
<p>We&#39;d probably still record an episode occasionally if we had kept things open-ended. As it was, we <strong>couldn&#39;t keep up the pace</strong> and eventually had to shut it down.</p>
<p>We’ve all seen messages like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Sorry guys, there won’t be a (comic/blog/video) today, I just need some time for self care …”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Leading up to and writing posts like that can be super stressful on their own. Inability to maintain an interval can take a toll on the creator as much as it deflates the unsatisfied audience. It can feel like a lose/lose scenario.</p>
<p>Besides, when it comes to creativity, <strong>&quot;when it&#39;s ready&quot;</strong> is usually the best answer (because we don&#39;t really know anyway).</p>
